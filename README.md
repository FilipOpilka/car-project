# car-project

This is a Java-based minimalist car simulator that enables users to create cars, set driving targets, 
and perform various driving actions such as accelerating, braking, and shifting gears. 
The project employs the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern to ensure code organization and maintainability. 
Additionally, the simulator leverages multithreading to facilitate parallel execution of tasks and optimize performance.
